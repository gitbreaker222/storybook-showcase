_Currently I move different code demos to this showcase made with Storybook.
It is a great tool for managing design systems and develop sustainable components.
I like to compare it with unit-tests for UI._

_**Update** 2 yrs later: Apparently I am satisfied that it just runs and is a bit customized. The setup is outdated anyway, because there are newer versions of [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/releases/7.0) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4). If I added new content, I would - of course - need to turn to the cool new stuff and start all over again. However I do care about some other content: Check out [Karaoke FÃ¼ller](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41C1ZD9QhWcwcQileUbVNI?si=58d393ba58cc4da2) playlist to inspire everyone! A balanced mix of quite all genres, fe-/male voices, english / german and curated for synched lyrics ðŸ¤©_
